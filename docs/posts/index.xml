But I&amp;rsquo;m getting ahead of myself. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a quick review of what is Vagrant
What is Vagrant Vagrant is a virtual machine (VM) provisioning tool that allows us to enjoy &amp;ldquo;Development Environment as Code&amp;rdquo; by configuring and managing VMs.</description></item><item><title>Defining installation location in build systems</title><link>https://www.antoniojgutierrez.com/posts/2021-05-23-difference_between_prefix_destir_in_build_systems/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 May 2021 20:16:34 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.antoniojgutierrez.com/posts/2021-05-23-difference_between_prefix_destir_in_build_systems/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s always a way to change the default installation location in every build system, and fortunately it&amp;rsquo;s almost always the same naming convention used to change them.
The way to change the installation directory is usually through these variables: DESTDIR and PREFIX.
The exact purpose of each, is not exactly clear from the name, and since you&amp;rsquo;d only change set if you&amp;rsquo;re doing a custom installation building from source (which is not very common) it&amp;rsquo;s been a common source of confusion.</description></item><item><title>Short and Long Options with Go flag standard package</title><link>https://www.antoniojgutierrez.com/posts/2021-05-14-short-and-long-options-in-go-flags-pkg/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 02:18:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.antoniojgutierrez.com/posts/2021-05-14-short-and-long-options-in-go-flags-pkg/</guid><description>Recently I was browsing the awesome age (which I encourage everyone to look at and use if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already), and noticed something that I had always mistakenly assumed wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible with the Go standard library.

Apparently it is possible!
To give a little more context, the short options are those that start with a single dash (-) and consist of a single letter, e.</description></item><item><title>Things to backup before doing a factory reset of an Android Phone</title><link>https://www.antoniojgutierrez.com/posts/2021-01-31-steps_todo_before_factory_reset_android/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 23:46:55 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.antoniojgutierrez.com/posts/2021-01-31-steps_todo_before_factory_reset_android/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s always something that I miss whenever I do a factory reset of my personal phone, whether it&amp;rsquo;s the signal backup (which is now enabled by the usage of a PIN), or some new 2FA code.

Today I decided to do something about it, and considering I hadn&amp;rsquo;t touch the Xorg conf files &amp;ldquo;generated&amp;rdquo; by nvidia-xconfig in more than 4 years, I was optimistic that it would be some configuration issue that would have been automatically resolved by now with newer drivers and OpenGL versions. Furthermore as the quotes on generated suggest, they weren&amp;rsquo;t pristine generated Xorg conf files since I had tinkered with them quite a bit in the past when I was running two Nvidia cards on Arch which I mentioned in passing in a previous post</description></item><item><title>Mounting/Playing/Ripping audio CDs like it's 1995 (in Arch Linux)</title><link>https://www.antoniojgutierrez.com/posts/2020-02-01-ripping_audio_cds_like_its_1995/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.antoniojgutierrez.com/posts/2020-02-01-ripping_audio_cds_like_its_1995/</guid><description>First post of the year!

So here&amp;rsquo;s the problem statement:

The first thing you need to do is have access to a Nvidia GPU, and in the first video lesson they show the setup of a cloud instance that runs Tensorflow using either crestle or paperspace.
But since either of them are paid by the hour, and considering I already have Nvidia GPU in my desktop (albeit not as powerful as the ones offered in the aforementioned services, just an GTX 1070), I thought of going in a tangent and setting it up myself.</description></item><item><title>Log base 10 vs Log base e notation</title><link>https://www.antoniojgutierrez.com/posts/2018-05-07-log_base_10_vs_log_base_e_notation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.antoniojgutierrez.com/posts/2018-05-07-log_base_10_vs_log_base_e_notation/</guid><description>I wrote this post after struggling for a few hours with the derivation of the negative log-likelihood function , and finding out that the derivative didn&amp;rsquo;t match what was expected, only to find out that it was indeed matching and that instead, there&amp;rsquo;s a discrepancy on the semantics of the &amp;ldquo;log&amp;rdquo; notation.

It has several completion engines for many languages including C/C++, Rust, Go, Python, Javascript among others. It contains two parts: a vim-plugin and a daemon.
A very simple explanation of how YouCompleteMe works is by starting a server whenever a file is opened whose filetype corresponds to one of the installed languages engines. After this, the file is analyzed by communicating with from vim using the vim plugin (client) to the daemon (server).</description></item><item><title>Automount SMB directory with systemd in Arch</title><link>https://www.antoniojgutierrez.com/posts/2018-04-09-automounting_systemd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.antoniojgutierrez.com/posts/2018-04-09-automounting_systemd/</guid><description>Problem statement I wanted to mount a directory from a local desktop in my laptop regardless of the OS it might be running at the moment.

The only moment where the heap property is maintained is when the queue is being populated, i.e: when elements are added to the queue.
This is better shown with a small example.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple PriorityQueue used as a min priority queue, of Vertex, which represents a vertex (node) of a Graph and its members are its index and its distance to the source vertex.</description></item><item><title>Removing of an Nvidia GPU from arch Linux with i3</title><link>https://www.antoniojgutierrez.com/posts/2017-08-20-changing_xorg_conf/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.antoniojgutierrez.com/posts/2017-08-20-changing_xorg_conf/</guid><description>This post is to help me and other people that might have had this issue before (and mostly future me).
When you have installed an Nvidia GPU in Arch Linux with i3 as Window Manager (WM), you probably needed to install and nvidia or another similar package, which contains drivers and generally includes a tool that automatically creates/modifies the Xorg configuration file (Xorg.conf), for the correct operation of the GPU in Arch and i3.</description></item><item><title>The Power of Habit</title><link>https://www.antoniojgutierrez.com/posts/2015-02-20-power_of_habit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.antoniojgutierrez.com/posts/2015-02-20-power_of_habit/</guid><description>This morning (or afternoon if you&amp;rsquo;re not a morning person) did you consciously decide which shoe to put first?
