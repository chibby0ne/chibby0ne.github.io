YouTube videos whenever there&amp;rsquo;s sudden movement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today I decided to do something about it, and considering I hadn&amp;rsquo;t touch the
Xorg conf files &amp;ldquo;generated&amp;rdquo; by &lt;code>nvidia-xconfig&lt;/code> in more than 4 years, I was
optimistic that it would be some configuration issue that would have been
automatically resolved by now with newer drivers and OpenGL versions.
Furthermore as the quotes on generated suggest, they weren&amp;rsquo;t pristine
generated Xorg conf files since I had tinkered with them
quite a bit in the past when I was running two Nvidia cards on Arch which I
mentioned in passing in a &lt;a href="https://www.antoniojgutierrez.com/2017/08/20/changing_xorg_conf.html">previous
post&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the first thing I did was generate a new Xorg conf, using the command:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$ nvidia-xconfig
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Which graciously backups the previous config and generates a new one in its stead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having done that I rebooted the computer, opened Firefox and scrolled some
long articles in Wikipedia (like the one for the current &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">Covid-19
Pandemic&lt;/a>) but the tearing
was still there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I searched the web and found &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmint/comments/9pb5ur/screen_tearing_while_scrolling/">this post on
reddit&lt;/a>
which basically describes exactly what was happening to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In it there are basically two solutions provided by the community:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Force GPU Acceleration on Firefox&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Force Full Composition Pipeline of the Nvidia card.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The first one was self explanatory and the simplest, besides if you have the
hardware you would want to use it whenever and wherever you can, specially in
a desktop environment, where you&amp;rsquo;re not restricted by power consumption from a
battery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As for the second option, from the comments and after looking into the good
ole trusty &lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA/Troubleshooting#Avoid_screen_tearing">Arch Wiki for screen tearing on
nvidia&lt;/a>,
it seems that while this &lt;em>does&lt;/em> avoid screen tearing not just in Firefox
but in every application, it comes with a performance penalty in OpenGL
applications as well as increasing the time needed for the GPU to &amp;ldquo;clock down&amp;rdquo;
i.e: bring its frequency back down due to changing power states after some
rendering task is finished.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since in my case I&amp;rsquo;ve only noticed the screen tearing in Firefox, it seemed
like a no-brainer opt for this approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To change I simply needed to go to the advanced preferences page of Firefox
reached by navigating to &lt;code>about:config&lt;/code> in the browser, search for
&lt;code>layers.acceleration.force-enabled&lt;/code>, set it to &lt;code>true&lt;/code> and restart Firefox.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Voilà.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Side note: The reason why GPU Acceleration is disabled by default in Firefox
on most, if not all Linux distributions is because WebGL is considered by many
as a security risk. For more a detailed explanation &lt;a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/13799/is-webgl-a-security-concern">check this

Yey!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like many other posts, the motivation of this one is to facilitate other
people running into the same issues as me, to quickly find
their solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here&amp;rsquo;s the problem statement:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You want to play an audio CD in an Arch Laptop or simply get the audio files. What do you do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well first you buy an external CD/DVD ROM player, which you can connect (and
power) through USB.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then you should mount it, to later get the files or simply rip them, right?&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you assume that mounting a CD ROM is exactly the same as mounting a
USB, then you would just connect the CD ROM player to the laptop, insert the
CD and
mount it with a command like:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#eed;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo mount /dev/sr0 /mnt/cdrom
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>But you would get an error:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#eed;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mount: /mnt/cdrom: can&lt;span style="color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2">&amp;#39;&lt;/span>t &lt;span style="color:#658b00">read&lt;/span> superblock on /dev/sr0.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So you search online the error and realize that it&amp;rsquo;s due to the fact that CD
doesn&amp;rsquo;t use the same filesystem as the laptop, which by default for most
distros is ext4. CDs/DVDs use a different filesystem. That filesystem is
ISO9660, which is the regular filesystem for optical media.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now you search online: for something like &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;mount+CD+ROM+linux&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>, which tells you the right command is:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#eed;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mount -t iso9660 -o ro /dev/sr0 /mnt/cdrom
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>But when you try it, you get this error:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#eed;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mount: /mnt/cdrom: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sr0, missing codepage or helper program, or other
error.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then you wonder if it&amp;rsquo;s a hardware issue and you look for the message buffer
of the kernel, using &lt;code>dmesg&lt;/code> and find some errors like:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#eed;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">[ 4325.239696] sr 1:0:0:0: [sr0] tag#0 FAILED Result: &lt;span style="color:#00688b">hostbyte&lt;/span>=DID_OK &lt;span style="color:#00688b">driverbyte&lt;/span>=DRIVER_SENSE

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Which suggest we are still trying to mount it wrongly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At which point you then start searching for: &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;mount+Audio+CD+linux&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>, which
leads you to this &lt;a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/204032">answer in unix
stackexchange&lt;/a>, which explains that
you &lt;strong>can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/strong> mount Audio CDs, you simply &lt;em>play them directly&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can try the command in the answer to verify that it in fact works:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>mplayer -cdrom-device /dev/cdrom -cache 5000 cdda://1
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This should get the ROM spinning and you would start hearing one of the audio tracks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ok so &lt;strong>Audio CDs can&amp;rsquo;t be mounted&lt;/strong>, so you skip to the second part, which is ripping the tracks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As usual, the ArchWiki has the answer. 99% of the times you have an issue in an
Arch installation it is already addressed in one article or another, but it
never ceases to surprise me how wide their breadth of topics is!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The article: &lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rip_Audio_CDs#Ripping">Rip Audio
CDs&lt;/a>, has the
command that would get you all tracks, which requires installing &lt;code>cdrtools&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#eed;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">cdda2wav -vall &lt;span style="color:#00688b">cddb&lt;/span>=&lt;span style="color:#b452cd">0&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#00688b">speed&lt;/span>=&lt;span style="color:#b452cd">4&lt;/span> -paranoia &lt;span style="color:#00688b">paraopts&lt;/span>=proof -B -D /dev/sr0
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>That will get your CD ROM spinning and after some minutes all the tracks in
your current directory as wav files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s more information in the article in case you would like to encode them
into other formats, like mp3 or flac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy listening!&lt;/p>

CC-BY-NC 4.0</description></item><item><title>Backing up Google Authenticators's Keys from an Android Phone</title><link>https://chibby0ne.github.io/posts/2019-12-15-backing_up_google_authenticator_keys/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chibby0ne.github.io/posts/2019-12-15-backing_up_google_authenticator_keys/</guid><description>Bits and pieces https://chibby0ne.github.io/posts/2019-12-15-backing_up_google_authenticator_keys/ -&lt;p>I wanted to backup my 2FA codes stored in Google&amp;rsquo;s Authenticator app. I don&amp;rsquo;t
want lose access to my accounts, in case I lose that phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sure there are also the backup codes, which are given/shown whenever 2FA is
set up, and are intended to be used on a rainy day such as when your
phone dies, gets stolen, or simply wiped accidentally or even on purpose but
they just forgot about the 2FA codes living there (not speaking from personal
experience at all of course :cry: ). Unfortunately, many people don&amp;rsquo;t pay too
much attention to these, myself included.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I &lt;strong>strongly encourage you to store those backup codes&lt;/strong> because you
never know when you&amp;rsquo;re going to need them. They have saved me in the past
from being able to access an account when my phone battery died, I had no
charger and needed to access it urgently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But in those cases where everything goes wrong, well you just have to reset
all accounts where you have 2FA, i.e: reset passwords and somehow prove that
you are who you say you are and not a malicious attacker that obtained the
passwords for those accounts (which is kind of a tricky situation for many
services since they don&amp;rsquo;t want to be accidentally victims of a social
engineering attack trying to collaborate with the so-claimed user).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully this serves as enough warning and encouragement to backup your 2FA
or simply write down the backup codes. If you get anything out of this post,
let it be that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now back to backing up the 2FA keys in Google Authenticator (GA) app: the main
advantage of this approach being that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to change/edit or add any
new device into any of your accounts, but instead you simply add the keys
manually to another 2FA app whether it lives in app in your phone, a desktop
app or somewhere else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You also don&amp;rsquo;t need to use any of your &lt;em>limited&lt;/em> backup codes in case you need
access and don&amp;rsquo;t have that one phone with all the 2FA keys at hand in that
moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This guide assumes you have rooted your Android phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to do this due to security concerns, then your only option
is to use the backup codes and that&amp;rsquo;s the end of this road for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t mind rooting your phone, and you haven&amp;rsquo;t there are many ways of
doing so, a simple duckduckgo search will lead you down the rabbithole.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition we will need
&lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb">adb&lt;/a> adb i.e: android
debug bridge. This is part of
the &lt;code>android-tools&lt;/code> package in Arch Linux. You can also download and install
it as part of the platform-tools from the &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools">Android
website&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This guide also assumes your phone is connected to the computer and you have
USB debugging enabled (For more detailed steps please check this &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options">official
android guide&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="run-adb-as-root">Run adb as root&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>First of we need to run adb as root. This is easier said that done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this we can run &lt;code>adb root&lt;/code> in a terminal, but it might be the case that after we do that
and try to fetch GA&amp;rsquo;s database we get the following error:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$ adb pull /data/data/com.google.android.apps.authenticator2/databases/databases
adb: error: failed to stat remote object '/data/data/com.google.android.apps.authenticator2/databases/databases': Permission denied
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;pre>&lt;code>$ sudo adb shell
AndroidPhone:/ $ ls -lh
ls: ./init.rc: Permission denied
ls: ./init: Permission denied
ls: ./ueventd.rc: Permission denied
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>You can also tell that the session is &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> a root session because the
prompt ends with &lt;code>$&lt;/code> instead of &lt;code>#&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$ adb root
adbd cannot run as root in production builds
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;pre>&lt;code>$ adb shell &amp;quot;su&amp;quot;
Permission denied
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>In my particular case, this is an issue caused of having Magisck Hide enabled,
mentioned in this &lt;a href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/issues/425#issuecomment-409101558">Github
issue&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In case you&amp;rsquo;re wondering Magisck Hide is part of
&lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-use-magisk/">Magisck&lt;/a> and is a feature
that &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>allows you put a cloaking device on root permissions for certain
apps.&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;. Very useful for banking apps, for instance, which don&amp;rsquo;t allow you to
login on a rooted device.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I decided to disable Magisck Hide for now and reboot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Afterwards I was able to start an adb root session:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$ adb root
restarting adbd as root
timeout expired while waiting for device
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>And then checking the prompt for the &lt;code>#&lt;/code> at the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$ adb shell
OnePlus3:/ # ls -lh

&lt;p>Afterwards I was able to pull the database, and I noticed that it hadn&amp;rsquo;t been
modified since many months ago, even though I had recently added new 2FA entries,
after trying to open it I only found a handful of 2FA keys, but I also noticed
something else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were two additional files next to the &lt;code>database&lt;/code> file: a &lt;code>-wal&lt;/code> and a &lt;code>-shm&lt;/code> file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After some more duckduckgo searching I found a well written in a well written and
useful &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@Zredna/browsing-your-android-apps-database-3c67aa3f4a3c">Medium
post&lt;/a>
by &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@Zredna">@Zredna&lt;/a>, in which he explore sqlite
databases in android apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In it he explains that the &lt;code>-wal&lt;/code> file, is used for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging">write-ahead
logging&lt;/a>, which is a
technique for providing atomicity and durability in databases, part of the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID properties&lt;/a>, and Wikipedia explains
that the technique relies on first writing the changes in the log &lt;strong>before&lt;/strong>
writing them in the database. Kind of the equivalent of journaling in filesystems.
In short the directory looked something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>OnePlus3:/data/data/com.google.android.apps.authenticator2/databases# ls -lh
total 2.7M
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 6K 1970-01-01 01:00 databases
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 80 1970-01-01 01:00 databases-shm
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10K 1970-01-01 01:00 databases-wal
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>As to the meaning of the &lt;code>-shm&lt;/code> file, that is a &lt;strong>shared-memory file&lt;/strong> and is
used by the sqlite databases when operating in WAL mode, used as an index of
the WAL file. You can read more about it the [sqlite tempfiles
documentation](here: &lt;a href="https://www.sqlite.org/tempfiles.html">https://www.sqlite.org/tempfiles.html&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So that required actually fetching both of those extra files in order to get a
complete picture of the current database state.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="opening-the-database">Opening the database&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>As per the blog, we need to commit the changes from the &lt;code>wal&lt;/code> file to the
database file, in order to do that we run the command:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>sqlite3 app.db &amp;quot;PRAGMA wal_checkpoint&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Afterwards, we can open the database using an interactive sqlite session,
select all the entries from the &lt;code>account&lt;/code> table:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$ sqlite3 ./databases
SQLite version 3.31.1 2019-12-10 19:55:54
Enter &amp;quot;.help&amp;quot; for usage hints.
sqlite&amp;gt; select * from accounts;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Or simply save all the values without an interactive session to another file:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>sqlite3 databases 'select * from accounts' &amp;gt; 2fa_accounts
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Which will write a table representation that looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$ cat 2fa_accounts
1|Github|asdf12345asdf|0|0|0||Github
2|Twitch|deadbeef101010|0|0|0||Twitch
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>And the 2FA private keys would be the &lt;strong>deadbeef101010&lt;/strong> and the
&lt;strong>asdf12345asdf&lt;/strong> in this case, which you can then now use in case you move to
a different phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it! Hope that helps you in some way!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS: These are &lt;strong>not real 2FA private keys&lt;/strong> in case you&amp;rsquo;re wondering, potential hacker.&lt;/p>

privates repositories from DockerHub you need to login first. With the docker
client CLI that&amp;rsquo;s achieved with:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>docker login
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>It then asks for the credentials to use for logging in.
The problem with this approach is explicitly mentioned in output of that
command.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my case:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.
Username: chibby0ne
Password:
WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in /home/turing/.docker/config.json.
Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The password is stored unencrypted (although not in plain-text).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Visiting the link you will find there are a number of docker-credentials
helpers in &lt;a href="https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers">docker-credentials-helpers&lt;/a> for every Operating
System.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Linux, I decided to go with &lt;a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass&lt;/a> and use the appropriate
docker-credential-helper for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pass is a password store that keeps passwords in a GPG encrypted file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The steps to set it up are very straightforward:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Install &lt;code>pass&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Install &lt;code>pass&lt;/code> using your package manager if its available, otherwise download
a release and install it using &lt;code>make install&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find all the options in the official website: &lt;a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Install &lt;code>docker-credential-pass&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need a Go installation to build the binaries. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have one yet
just install it using your package manager, and set the &lt;code>GOPATH&lt;/code> environment
variable to the place where you want to have your go projects. For more
information visit:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assuming you have a Go installation then:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Fetch the sources with:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>go get github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This will download the repo and place it in
&lt;code>$GOPATH/src/github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Build the helper that uses pass by running:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>make pass
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The binary &lt;code>docker-credential-pass&lt;/code> will be located in the &lt;code>bin/&lt;/code> directory.
You need to copy the binary to a directory included in the &lt;code>PATH&lt;/code> environment so
that the docker client CLI can actually find it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Log out&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Run &lt;code>docker logout&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you where already logged in you should see:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Removing login credentials for https://index.docker.io/v1/
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>If you where not logged in, you should see:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Not logged in to https://index.docker.io/v1/
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Modify the &lt;code>~/.docker/config.json&lt;/code> to use the &lt;code>docker-credential-pass&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add the following key/value pair:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> &amp;quot;credsStore&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>By now your &lt;code>~/.docker/config.json&lt;/code> should look something like this
(User-Agent might be different):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>{
&amp;quot;auths&amp;quot;: {},
&amp;quot;HttpHeaders&amp;quot;: {
&amp;quot;User-Agent&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Docker-Client/18.05.0-ce (linux)&amp;quot;
},
&amp;quot;credsStore&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Initialize &lt;code>pass&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to tell pass which GPG keypair you&amp;rsquo;re going to use to encrypt/decrypt
the password.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Run:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>pass init GPG_ID
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Where GPG_ID is the fingerprint or email address that identifies the key.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a GPG keypair yet, then proceed to create it using:
&lt;code>gpg --full-gen-key&lt;/code> and configure the settings using the interactive prompt.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Login&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Run &lt;code>docker login&lt;/code> and enter your credentials, but this time after entering
the username and password, you should see a prompt to enter the password for
the selected GPG key.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Important to note is that the output should not have the warning message
anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Done!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it. Now the you are logged in but the credentials are not stored
unencrypted in the &lt;code>~/.docker/config.json&lt;/code> file.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

approach into the world of machine learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing you need to do is have access to a Nvidia GPU, and in the
first video lesson they show the setup of a cloud instance that runs
Tensorflow using either &lt;a href="https://www.crestle.com">crestle&lt;/a> or
&lt;a href="https://www.paperspace.com">paperspace&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But since either of them are paid by the hour, and considering I already have
Nvidia GPU in my desktop (albeit not as powerful as the ones offered in the
aforementioned services, just an GTX 1070), I thought of going in a tangent
and setting it up myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing to do is install Tensorflow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I already had CUDA installed, so I proceeded to install Tensorflow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was a problem: the CUDA version was too bleeding edge for the Tensroflow
version. Tensorflow 1.9 requires CUDA 9.0 and the latest CUDA in Arch
repositories was 9.1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought of compiling Tensorflow myself, since that would make it work with
9.1. But that would take a long time and probably space as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead I opted out for a docker image which required &lt;a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nvidia-docker/">nvidia-docker&lt;/a> from AUR,
and rebooting the docker-service. Then I followed the instructions found in
the &lt;a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker">github repository&lt;/a> to run the
image after it pulled it. Afterwards, I started a Jupyter Notebook that
required a token to login, which was specified in the output of the jupyter
command line prompt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once inside the jupyter notebook, I was finally able to run Tensroflow with
GPU acceleration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simple enough if you know where to look. But even if digging up took some
time, is time well spent considering the speedup achieved with GPU
acceleration when using Tensorflow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s go step by step:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two of the most common logarithms are the logarithm of base $$e$$, also called
natural logarithm which is written in two forms:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$\ln{x} = \log_{e}{x}$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and the logarithm of base 10 also called common logarithm or decimal
logarithm:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ \log_{10}{x}$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally scientific calculators have a &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>log&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; and a &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>ln&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo; function,
which apply the logarithm of base 10 and the logarithm of base $$e$$ respectively:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Logarithm_keys.jpg" alt="log keys in calculator">&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="by-waifer-x---100502-1150494uploaded-by-pieter-kuiper-cc-by-20-httpscommonswikimediaorgwindexphpcurid10715338">By Waifer X - 100502-1150494Uploaded by Pieter Kuiper, CC BY 2.0, &lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=10715338">https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=10715338&lt;/a>&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>But something that I learned while checking for errors doing the derivative is that mathematicians and calculator designers
have different things in mind when writing &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>log&lt;/strong>&amp;quot;:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From Wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_logarithm">Common Logarithm&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>On calculators it is usually &amp;ldquo;log&amp;rdquo;, but mathematicians usually mean natural logarithm (logarithm with base e ≈ 2.71828) rather than common logarithm when they write &amp;ldquo;log&amp;rdquo;. To mitigate this ambiguity the ISO 80000 specification recommends that $$log_{10}{x}$$ should be written $$lg{x}$$ and $$log_{e}{x}$$ should be $$ln{x}$$.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And from Wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm">Natural Logarithm&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The natural logarithm of x is generally written as $$ln x$$, $$log_{e} x$$, or sometimes, if the base $$e$$ is implicit, simply $$log x$$.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Therefore in the case of the negative log-likelihood function:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ L(\boldsymbol{y}) = - \log(\boldsymbol{y}) $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although it&amp;rsquo;s not implicit that it refers to a logarithm of base $$e$$, &lt;em>it is
indeed the natural logarithm&lt;/em>, it&amp;rsquo;s just being used as mentioned in the given
excerpt of common logarithm (i.e: mathematicians usually mean natural logarithm when they write &amp;ldquo;log&amp;rdquo;), and therefore its derivative is:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ \dfrac{\partial L_{\boldsymbol{y}}}{\partial \boldsymbol{y}} = -\dfrac{1}{\boldsymbol{y}} $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mathematicians be crazy!&lt;/p>

for the vim editor. It has several completion engines for many languages
including C/C++, Rust, Go, Python, Javascript among others. It contains two
parts: a vim-plugin and a daemon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A very simple explanation of how YouCompleteMe works is by starting a server
whenever a file is opened whose filetype corresponds to one of the installed
languages engines. After this, the file is analyzed by communicating with from
vim using the vim plugin (client) to the daemon (server).
&lt;em>The languages for which YouCompleteMe provides auto completion are selected
are install time, therefore if you don&amp;rsquo;t explicitly install it selecting a
language, autocompletion for that language will probably be disabled.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Javascript, &lt;a href="http://ternjs.net/">tern&lt;/a> is used for the code analysis. Tern itself
requires a &lt;code>.tern-project&lt;/code> or a &lt;code>.tern-config&lt;/code> file describing the specific
configuration in the root of the project or above or the home directory
respectively. Tern then opens a server in a unused port that listens for POST
requests from a client that asks questions about the code in the form of JSON.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When vim is started is runs tern in a separate process and starts the
querying whenever possible as described before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, tern supports server plugins, which are normal Javascript
programs that add extra functionality to the server. There are a few plugins
that come with the distribution such as doc and nodejs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now what if I wanted to develop a Chrome Extension and wanted the
autocompletion for the Chrome API in vim?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well since tern supports this it would be only a matter of installing the tern
plugin and adding the plugin to the &lt;code>.tern-project&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First installing the tern Chrome Extension:
I found this &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tern-chrome-extension">tern-chrome-extension&lt;/a> which worked
pretty well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we can&amp;rsquo;t just install it in the project directory that would install it in
the &lt;code>node modules&lt;/code> but vim(and tern) would be aware of it. We have to install it
in &lt;code>node_modules&lt;/code> of the tern instance that&amp;rsquo;s run by vim.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To find it we run, with a vim instance reading a Javascript file:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>ps aux | grep tern
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>We find that the process is running as:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>/usr/bin/node /home/user/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/tern_runtime/node_modules/tern/bin/tern --port 46973 --host 127.0.0.1 --persistent --no-port-file
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>We want to navigate to this directory &lt;code>/home/user/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/tern_runtime/&lt;/code>, because the &lt;code>node_modules&lt;/code> is the place where we want it to be installed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We run:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>npm install --prefix . tern-chrome-extension
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>And we make sure everything went ok by checking if there&amp;rsquo;s a directory with
that name in &lt;code>node_modules&lt;/code> or in the &lt;code>package.json&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$ cat package.json
{
&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;ycmd tern runtime area with required tern version and plugins&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;dependencies&amp;quot;: {
&amp;quot;tern&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;0.21.0&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;tern-chrome-extension&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;^46.1.20160420&amp;quot;
}
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Now all that&amp;rsquo;s needed to create/edit the &lt;code>.tern-project&lt;/code> file, and add the
chrome-extension to the plugins section.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$ cat .tern-project
{
&amp;quot;libs&amp;quot;: [
&amp;quot;browser&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;ecma5&amp;quot;
],
&amp;quot;plugins&amp;quot;: {
&amp;quot;node&amp;quot;: {},
&amp;quot;chrome-extension&amp;quot;: {}
}
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it! Now you can enjoy having the Chrome API completion in vim.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I wanted to mount a directory from a local desktop in my laptop regardless of
the OS it might be running at the moment. Also, not just mount it. &lt;em>Automount&lt;/em>
it either whenever I boot or on demand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the moment in my particular case, both laptop and desktop are running Arch
Linux.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First let&amp;rsquo;s do a bit of a primer:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="smb-primer">SMB Primer&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>SMB&lt;/em> is a network protocol (that also acts as a network/distributed file
system) used for sharing file and print services between Windows clients. The
original version was also known as &lt;em>CIFS&lt;/em>, and since then both names are used
interchangeably.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Samba is a FOSS implementation of the SMB protocol that runs on *nix systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other competitor to SMB is NFS, but the former is more Windows oriented as
it was originally created for the Microsoft ecosystem, while the latter was
created towards a more *nix friendly environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using SMB is the traditionally way of sharing directories between Linux/Windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TL;DR: SMB for Windows/Linux. NFS for Linux/Linux.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-to-install">What to install&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>You need the install &lt;code>cifs-utils&lt;/code> which provides user-space tools for mounting
SMB/CIFS file systems (or shares as they are also called).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, &lt;code>cifs-utils&lt;/code> add the possibility of selecting cifs as filesystem to
&lt;code>mount&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="credentials">Credentials&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We create a file containing the credentials used for that.
Unfortunately there&amp;rsquo;s no other way that I&amp;rsquo;m aware of, of storing the
credentials other than &lt;em>plaintext&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The file should contain two entries as such:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>username=USERNAME
password=PASSWORD
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>You should store it somewhere in /etc/samba/ and set its permissions to 600 so
that only root has read/write access.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="mount-file">Mount file&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The mount file contains the information on how to mount the filesystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One important note is that &lt;strong>the filename should encode the mount point,
otherwise systemd will fail at mounting it&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The filename should be of the pattern:
&lt;code>directory1-directory2-directory3.mount&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where the actual path where it is mounted is:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>/directory1/directory2/directory3&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is, the internal forward slashes of the path should be the minuses (&amp;quot;-&amp;quot;)
in the filename.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Otherwise you will get an error like this&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$ systemctl start mntdir.mount
$ systemctl status mntdir.mount
...
...
mntdir.mount's Where= setting doesn't match unit name. Refusing
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This file should contain something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>[Unit]

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Replacing the upper case values with the relevant parameters in your case.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automount-file">Automount file&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The automount file contains the information as to where and how to automount.
This automount works on-demand, i.e: it mounts the filesystem when you
navigate to that directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just like the mount file: the name of the file should encode the mount
location. i.e: it should have the same name as the &lt;code>.mount&lt;/code> file but with the
file extension: &lt;code>.automount&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Its contents should be something like this:&lt;/p>

keeping in mind that the &lt;code>PATH_TO_MOUNT_POINT&lt;/code> should be the same as the one
in the &lt;code>.mount&lt;/code> file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This file should be enabled so that it runs at boot.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>systemctl enable mnt-dir.automount
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Asumming the mount point is /mnt/dir (and therefore the filename is
mnt-dir.automout).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tips">Tips&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In my particulaar case no matter what &lt;code>Requires&lt;/code>, &lt;code>After&lt;/code> and/or &lt;code>Wants&lt;/code>
service you select, enabling the &lt;code>.mount&lt;/code> file so that it runs automatically
at boot, the system will fail to mount it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even more, I found that most guides and tutorials used the automount as the
actual enabled unit, which mounts on demand and not on boot.&lt;/p>

experiment, learn and use cluster technologies like Kubernetes, Apache Hadoop,
Spark, and even small programs using RPC and OpenMP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In setting up the raspberry pi (a process which I think I&amp;rsquo;m fairly acquainted
with) I ran through a few things which caught me by surprise, or were
completely new to me, so after being half way into the process I wanted to
write it down so that people that might want to undertake it, can it setup up
much more smoothly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hardware">Hardware&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I chose to be as minimal and cheap as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="devices-and-microsd">Devices and MicroSD&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The cluster consists of 3 Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s: 2 of which are RPI 3 B+, and other
one is a RPI 3 B, with 2 32 GB and 1 64 GB microSDs respectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="network">Network&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>They will be connected to the network using the integrated wifi module. No
external dongles, or ethernet cables are required. Saving money!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="case">Case&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I bought a dog bone cluster case in Amazon, that fits 4 Pis in case future me
decides to expand the cluster.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="power-supply">Power supply&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>30W 3-Port USB Wall Charger. It can output up to 2 A per port.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="flashing-the-cards">Flashing the cards&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I flashed the minimal Raspbian Stretch image, since I don&amp;rsquo;t need any GUI or
X session running for applications I have mind (so far at least).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This process was simple just repeat it 3 times with different micro sd cards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I knew that once flashed, I could mount the sd in my desktop, and edit the
&lt;code>boot/&lt;/code> and the &lt;code>rootfs/&lt;/code> partition to configure them whichever way I want, but
there were still a few things I didn&amp;rsquo;t have completely clear.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="configuring-each-device">Configuring each device&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At first I decided to configure one of them manually so that I can take note
on what group of file configuration constitute the minimum to be able to ssh
to them remotely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Immediately I realized I had flashed the smallest image without GUI, therefore
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t attach a Monitor. Ethernet for ssh&amp;rsquo;ing wasn&amp;rsquo;t an option since I
didn&amp;rsquo;t have any spare cables, that could reach the router.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, I have a USB-to-Serial 3.3V cable that can be used to open a
Linux console. In fact, one could argue it is even more useful than having an
Ethernet connection, since it captures even the boot sequence, something you
can&amp;rsquo;t do with ssh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I attached usb cable from my desktop to the pi and powered it on, and I
waited for a bit. Then a longer bit. There was nothing. No output.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An auspicious start :p&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I quickly remembered something about the RPI 3 changing the way serial
connection is used. So I consult &lt;a href="https://elinux.org/RPi_Serial_Connection">elinux page for RPi Serial Connection&lt;/a>
and effectively, ever since RPI 3, UART is disabled by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went back, took the microsd out of the pi, and edited the &lt;code>/boot/config.txt&lt;/code>
as mentioned in the wiki, adding a line with &lt;code>enable_uart=1&lt;/code>, popped the
microSD back and now I could see the booting sequence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re in business!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I start editing:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;code>/etc/hostname&lt;/code> and &lt;code>/etc/hosts&lt;/code> with the hostnames I wanted to use. In my
case, I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;code>rpiX&lt;/code> where &lt;code>X&lt;/code> is an increasing number for each device
in the cluster, starting from 0.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> &lt;em>Initially I only edited &lt;code>/etc/hostname/&lt;/code>, in addition to the
other files, and rebooted, but during the boot sequence I noticed the pi
still used the default &lt;code>raspberry&lt;/code> hostname. After reading the &lt;a href="https://wiki.debian.org/HowTo/ChangeHostname">Debian
Wiki&lt;/a>, I learned that changing /etc/hosts is also required so that local
addresses can resolve with the new hostname&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;code>/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf&lt;/code>, adding the network entry
with the wifi&amp;rsquo;s SSID and Credentials. This is one of those files that I
could copy to the rest in the cluster.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;code>/etc/dhcpcd.conf&lt;/code>, setting the static ip address, router, and gateway for
the &lt;code>wlan0&lt;/code> interface (the name used for the interfaces by the raspbian
images). In my case, I&amp;rsquo;m using from &lt;code>192.168.178.X&lt;/code> where &lt;code>X&lt;/code> is an
increasing number for each device in the cluster starting with 5.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Those are the three files I could think of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I ran the &lt;code>raspi-config&lt;/code> tool to enable wifi, shrink the GPU, set the
locale, and keyboard layout.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I rebooted. Everything seem OK. Verified that wifi was working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now all I had to do was copy all the files I edited to the other two microSD
cards, with the consideration of increasing the hostname number (as explained
in #1, and ip address (as explained in #3).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After doing so, and inserting the remaining microSDs, I was expecting to see
the other two pi&amp;rsquo;s in nmap as I could see the first one, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point I remembered that even with the configuration of the interface
(dhcpcd more precisely) and wpa_supplicant, I still had to run &lt;code>raspi-config&lt;/code>
to enable the wifi and bluetooth. I thought this might be a rfkill switch on
disabling the radio signals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using the usb serial cable I checked the status of dhcpcd.service:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> &lt;em>The artifacts shown in the output are part of the minicom output&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The line that confirms it is:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Mar 13 22:53:26 rpi1 dhcpcd[331]: wlan0: if_up: Operation not possible due to RF
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>I knew about Linux&amp;rsquo;s rfkill because that&amp;rsquo;s what laptops enable/disable when
you press the function (Fn) key that enables/disable wifi in Linux. There are
two types of block: soft and hard block. Normally laptops&amp;rsquo; Fn key shortcut
enable/disable a soft block.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To find out what case is there is I ran:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>pi@rpi1:/dev$ rfkill list all
0: phy0: Wireless LAN
Soft blocked: yes
Hard blocked: no
1: hci0: Bluetooth
Soft blocked: no
Hard blocked: no
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>I ran &lt;code>rfkill unblock all&lt;/code> and verified that the Wireless was indeed
unblocked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t know of another way of unblocking the radios, other than the command
line utility, therefore no copying of file there. Or is there?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could add this line to the &lt;code>/etc/rc.local&lt;/code> script, that is run by init after
the system finished changing runlevels as part of the boot process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although there was only one more pi left to be configured I wanted to see if I
could set it up the wifi connection from the microSD without booting the pi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I did this for the 3rd pi&amp;rsquo;s microSD card, and verified with nmap from my
desktop.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Nmap scan report for 192.168.178.7
Host is up (0.073s latency).
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Finally, I was able to set up a pi&amp;rsquo;s wifi by directly editing the microsd on
my desktop, without needing to boot into the device. All in all, it was a
very enlightening experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I can ssh to it, I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to disassemble the cluster again
again to attach the usb-serial cable (which I did two times =( ), to set up
the kubernetes/hadoop tech stack.&lt;/p>

I mostly use i3 because I like how it, as a tiling manager, efficiently uses
all of the monitor&amp;rsquo;s real state.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Something that I might forget in the future and was mildly annoying when I
made the shift to i3, is making sure thunar (xfce4 file manager) had the
option of &lt;em>Open Terminal Here&lt;/em> &lt;strong>and&lt;/strong> that it opened the right terminal.
After a few minutes of googling, I figured out how to add the option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Problem was that it was always opening &lt;code>xfce4-terminal&lt;/code>, and not &lt;code>urvxt&lt;/code> terminal
which is the terminal emulator I use for i3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After digging in a bit, I discovered that the &lt;em>Open Terminal Here&lt;/em> option is
actually a custom action of thunar itself, that can be edited in &lt;code>Edit &amp;gt; Configure custom actions...&lt;/code>, there you find the action &lt;em>Open Terminal
Here&lt;/em> After clicking edit I could see the command that is being executed. The
funny thing is that it didn&amp;rsquo;t execute xfce4-terminal. Instead it runs
&lt;code>exo-open&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s how I learned that &lt;code>exo-open&lt;/code> is a shell command that is comes with the
&lt;code>exo&lt;/code> package, and allows you open urls and launch preferred applications in xfce4.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All I needed to do then is to modify the preferred application for terminal
emulator in &lt;code>xfce4-settings-manager&lt;/code>, set &lt;code>urxvt&lt;/code> and voila!&lt;/p>
