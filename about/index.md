I'm [Antonio Gutierrez][linkedin] and I'm a Computer Engineer from Venezuela. I hold a BS degree in Electronics Engineering with a major in Automation and Control from the [Rafael Belloso Chacin University][urbe] and a MS degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a major in Embedded Systems from the [Technical University of Kaiserslautern][tuk]. I've previously worked in the Industrial Automation sector for a bit more than a year and now I'm more oriented towards Embedded Systems.

I'm experienced in C, C++, Python, Shell scripting, and have dabbled in Java.

Additonally, I'm well experienced in in the Hardware Description Language VHDL, which I used for my masters' thesis. 

I love learning and as such, in my spare time I completed several courses from [Udacity][udacity] and [Coursera][coursera] such as Intro to Computer Science, Intro to Statistics, Algorithms I, Algorithms II.

I am overly attached fan of [VIM][vim].

In my spare time you can find me reading a book, reading/editing wikipedia articles, watching educational youtube videos, or hacking away.
