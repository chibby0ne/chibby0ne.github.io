I'm [Antonio][linkedin] and I'm a Software Developer from Venezuela, currently located in Munich, Germany. I hold a M.Sc. degree in Embedded Systems from the [Technical University of Kaiserslautern][tuk]. I worked for over 2 years as a Software Engineer for [Intel][intel] in Ulm and then here in Munich in GUI Development of Eclipse for IoT, Microcontrollers and Debugger Tools, and before that I worked in the Industrial Automation sector for almost two year using Siemens PLCs. Nowadays, I'm orienting my career more towards data science and machine learning.

On the Software side I'm proficient in C, C++, Java, and experienced in Python, Bash and golang.

Additionally on the Hardware side, I'm well experienced in the Hardware Description Language VHDL, which I used for my masters' thesis. 

I love learning and as such, in my spare time I have taken several courses from [Udacity][Udacity] and [Coursera][Coursera] such as Intro to Computer Science, Intro to Statistics, Machine Learning, Algorithms I and Algorithms II. I also love staying in touch with the latest developments in Software Development, that has led me to dabble with [Docker][docker] and [Kubernetes][kubernetes].

I am a huge fan of [vim][vim] and Linux. My current distro of choice is [Arch Linux][archlinux]. I'm also starting to grow fond of the [golang][golang] programming language.

When I'm not doing creating something using any of the above, you can find me reading a book, reading/editing Wikipedia articles, watching educational YouTube videos, or hacking away.

I have several diverse interests, some related to my line of work are: Machine Learning, Data Science, Cloud computing, Container technology, Blockchain technology, Ambient Intelligence (IoT), Robotics, Sustainable Transportation, among others.
