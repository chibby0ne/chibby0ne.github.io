After watching the 2 hour+ interview of Chris Lattner in the Lex Fridman
podcast I just *had* to write down some of the gems I heard from Chris
Lattner.

* ***“Turns out if you ask a lot of dumb questions, you learn pretty quickly”***

* ***“In a way, types are like assertions which are checked at compile time”***

* ***“Just making a hello world, won't get you get used to the language. Your mind
  need time and practice. Is the same as if you change diet, you need time for
  your metabolism to adapt”***

* ***“What I mean by messed up: very rarely used for good, often used for bugs”***

* ***“Being first principles where you're coming from and what you're trying to
  achieve”***

* ***“Fun things about learning programming languages: when you start doing
  them, you start learning new things. You have a new way of doing things and
  you're forced to do them, and that forces you to explore. That puts you in
  learning mode and your mind kind of opens a little bit. And you start seeing
  things differently even the old things”***

These are just some of the few nuggets of wisdoms and insights that I stuck
with me after watching it. These long form conversations from Lex Fridman, are
an awesome medium through which I learn form other people and I find it
particularly engrossing since it allows more nuance in the dialogue.

I 1000% recommend [this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWTvXbQHwWs)
and the podcast itself, and will probably write down some more notes for
future episodes.
