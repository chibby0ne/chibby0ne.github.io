{{< about "antonio_profile.jpg" >}}

I'm Antonio and I'm a Software Developer from Venezuela, currently located in Munich, Germany.

I like to tinker in [several open source projects][projects].

I'm a huge fan of [vim][vim] (also [neovim][neovim]) and Linux. My current distro of choice is [Arch Linux][archlinux]. I'm also starting to grow fond of the [rust][rust], [go][golang] and [haskell][haskell] programming languages.

I occasionally [write]({{< ref "/posts/" >}}) about my interests in machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, software development, Linux, and things that I've learned along the way.
